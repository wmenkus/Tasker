# Tasker

Tasker is an app I created to randomize a set of daily chores from three buckets. Tasks being selected randomly helps combat ADHD, ensuring that while the chores are not on a set schedule, they also are done frequently enough. Certain considerations were also taken with tasks such as laundry, ensuring that washing would always be followed by folding, and that litterbox cleaning was done once every 3-4 days. The app is fairly flexible in that the task lists (monthlies.txt, weeklies.txt) can be added to or removed from as situations change. Compile with javac *.java
